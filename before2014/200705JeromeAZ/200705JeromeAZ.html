<h1>Bike Ride from Jerome Views Road to the town of Jerome, AZ</h1>

On my first day in Arizona, dad points out a little speck of a town, high up on a mountainside, and says he has always wondered if he could make it up there via bicycle.  Hypothesis put forth, the only way to know is experimentation.  The answer is yes.

Jerome is a refurbished ghost town. Mining is out, art galleries and gourmet lunch spots are in.  A short walk from the art galleries was a busy watering hole with live music and a long row of beautiful, shiny motorcycles.
