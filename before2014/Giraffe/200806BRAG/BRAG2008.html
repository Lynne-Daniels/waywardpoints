<h1>A Very Complex Rumor, or the True Map of BRAG 2008?</h1>
<p>The data for this map is from <a href="http://www.georgiatandemrally.com/braggps.html">www.georgiatandemrally.com/braggps.html</a>.  I found this via an internet bulletin board.  I'm not sure if it is official, correct, or accurate, but it is an impressive collection of data.  Kudos and accolades to the cartographer.  The ride looks bigger all mapped out like that.</p>
