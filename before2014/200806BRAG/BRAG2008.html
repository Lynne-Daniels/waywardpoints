<h1>Map of BRAG 2008</h1>
<h2>The 29th Annual Bike Ride Across Georgia</h2>
<p>Details of the ride available here:  <a href="http://www.brag.org">www.brag.org</a></p>
<p>The data for this map is from <a href="http://www.georgiatandemrally.com/braggps.html">www.georgiatandemrally.com/braggps.html</a>.  This impressive collection of tracks and waypoints was assembled and marked up by Roger Strauss.  Kudos and accolades are due to the cartographer.</p>
<p>I think I understand how to edit descriptions or maybe even add waypoints without breaking the map.  Let me know if there is any important and/or entertaining information, trivia, or folklore that should be added to the map. <a href="mailto:way@waywardpoints.com">lynne@waywardpoints.com</a></p>
