<td>On the first day came the free upgrade to an oceanview room.  Thank you <a href ="http://www.turksandcaicosclub.com/">Turks and Caicos Club</a>.<br><br>  Look, there is double rainbow, and it is not raining.</td>

<td>We rode the resorts' beach cruisers from Grace Bay to Sailing Paradise in the Blue Hills area.  The bikes were a bit iffy, and the roads really questionable, but the local drivers were amazingly courteous.</td></tr>

<td>"Da Conch Shack" served a nice lunch.  We ate conch chowder and watched the conch wrangler sort out dinner from a corral out back.</td>

<td>Sail Provo took us snorkling and made a very nice rum punch.  The punch made me very merry.  We drank, snorkeled and watched the sunset.</td>

<td>The best thing about this trip was the beach and the snorkling.  Our hotel was between White House Reef and Smith's Reef.  I swam to White House Reef every morning.  I saw sea turtles every day.  The reefs had all sorts of fan corals and some fish.  I took lots of really, really bad pictures with a disposable underwater camera.  After I used up all the underwater film, I saw a Lion Fish and three HUGE spotted Eagle Rays at Smith's Reef. Really, I did.  Take me back.  I'll show you.</td></tr>
