		<h4>What is a permanent?</h4>
			<p>A permanent is a predefined cycling route of 200km (125 miles) or more in length.  A RUSA member known as the route owner has defined a route and several stopping points called controls.  At each control, riders will obtain a store receipt and initials or a  stamp in their brevet card to show they completed the course.  Each control must be reached between predefined minimum and maximum times.  The course will not be signposted or marked.  There is no sag support.  Each rider should be self-sufficient and prepared to navigate the route using a cue sheet and/or GPS device.  Before riding a permanent, contact the route owner for permission and instructions on delivering the completed waiver form and brevet card.  To be credited with completion of the ride, the entire route must be ridden, and all controls must be reached during the specified time limits.
