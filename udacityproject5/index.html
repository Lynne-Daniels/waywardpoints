					<h3>About the Ride</h3>

					<p>This all day ride tours beautiful sections of the
					Northern Everglades. Beginning at the Publix grocery store
					paking lot in Jupiter Farms, the route winds through
					Riverbend Park onto the Bluegill trail and over to Grassy
					Waters. These sections are mostly shellrock, but Grassy
					Waters may have some deeper sand. Also the section of
					Bluegill trail between PGA and the B-Line isn't actually
					built yet, so be ready to bump along in the grassy
					doubletrack. Grassy Waters is a great spot for birding and
					wildlife viewing. After leaving Grassy Waters preserve,
					there are some gravel and paved roads in
					residential/agricultural neighborhoods. Be sure to stop at
					the shopping plaza in the Acreage for resupply. It is the
					last chance to buy food or water until the end of the
					route.</p>


					<p>The western section of the route traverses the Corbett
					Wildlife Management Area. Wear some blaze orange in hunting
					season. The road is open to cars, but because it is remote
					and in terrible condition, there are few vehicles. After
					Corbett, the route travels the gravel roads in Hungryland
					WMA, then returns east on the old Indiantown Grade. The
					western section of the Indiantown Grade is rough
					doubletrack, crossing several swales. Riders may want to
					bail out and finish via the paved road in the wet season
					(July - Sept) when the swales are full of water and the
					grass gets long. There are alligators and water moccasins
					and stuff back there.</p>
